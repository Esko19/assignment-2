<p><b><em>Stevan Stojanović Mokranjac (January 9, 1856–1914) was a Serbian composer and music educator. His work was essential in bringing the spirit of Valach Serbian unwritten folk poems into organized art.</em></b> </p>

<h1> Biography </h1>

<h1>NEW </h1>
<p> He was born in Negotin. From the birthplace of his parents he drew the second last name Mokranjac (literally: resident of Mokranje).<br><br>

He graduated from the Belgrade high school, and attended the natural science and mathematics section of the University of Belgrade. <br><br>
In 1879 he traveled to Munich where he studied music in the class of Josef Rheinberger. After a brief break, he continued to study in Rome in the class of Parisotti, in 1884. <br><br>
Returning to Serbia in 1884 he briefly became the conductor of the Kornelije Stanković choir of Belgrade.

From 1885 to 1887 he studied music in Leipzig, Germany.<br><br>
 Upon his return to Serbia in 1887 he became the conductor of the Belgrade singing society (Belgrade Choir).<br><br> From 1887 to 1900 he taught music at the Belgrade high school, and in 1901 transferred to Bogoslovija (Belgrade Theological College) where he taught church singing. <br><br>
 Together with Stanislav Binički and Cvetko Manojlović, Mokranjac founded the first independent music school in 1899 - Serbian Music School in Belgrade. He remains the director of this school until his death. <br><br>
 Today the school bears his name. His work as a melograph bore many transcriptions of thus far unwritten folk songs.

Stevan Mokranjac died in Skopje, Macedonia (then Kingdom of Serbia), aged 58.<br><br>

Every year, the town of Negotin organizes a music festival in his honor called Mokranjčevi dani (Days of Mokranjac). The town also has a Mokranjac museum.</p>

<h1> Works </h1>

<p>His life was highly influenced by church and folk songs, and he used these two types of music as inspiration for his work.<br><br>
     His most famous pieces are the fifteen Rukoveti (Potpourri; literally: "handfuls" or "bunches") - a collection of songs and music (orchestral suites) <br>based on motives of Serbian folk music from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia Proper, Montenegro, Kosovo and Metohija, Macedonia and Bulgaria.<br><br>
      His other prominent folk-based works include Primorski napjevi (Coastland tunes), and Kozar.

A significant number of his works were made for church services.<br>
 Such as the Božanstvena Liturgija Svetog Jovana Zlatoustog (The Divine Liturgy of St. Chrysostom), from which the Heruvimska pesma (Cherubic hymn) is most famous. <br><br>
 Another two famous religious pieces are Tebe Boga hvalim (Te Deum) and Veličanije Sv. Savi (Megalynarion to St. Sava).</p>
